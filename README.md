## Portfolio – React + Tailwind CSS

This is a compact, modern personal portfolio built with **Vite + React + TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS v4**.  
It is designed for easy deployment on Vercel and to look great on phones, tablets, and desktops.

### Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL in your browser.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder that Vercel (or any static host) can serve.

### Deploying to Vercel

In Vercel:

- **Framework preset**: Other
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Output directory**: `dist`

No custom server is required; this is a pure frontend app.
